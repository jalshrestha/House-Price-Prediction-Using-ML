# House-Price-Prediction-Using-ML


This project predicts house prices using the California Housing Dataset and various machine learning models.

Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict the median house value based on features like median income, total rooms, and housing median age.

Key Steps:
Data Cleaning: Handled missing values and outliers.
Feature Engineering: Created new features, applied transformations.
Modeling: Trained models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and more.
Evaluation: Compared models using metrics like RÂ² score and MSE.



Models Used

Random Forest
Decision Tree
Lasso
Ridge
Results

The best-performing model was Random Forest with the highest accuracy in predicting house prices.
